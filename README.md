# Reef!

Reef is a programming language i am developing for one of my computer science
projects in college! Written wholly in rust, its a language based around
simplicity and efficiency. I hope to make it turing complete by the project
deadline, but if i complete it before then, ill hopefully add some more features.

Its mainly inspired by lua, c++, and rust, and similarities to each of these can
be found in the syntax.

# Running

Simply clone the repository and build using cargo. The reef-core library *should*
be built if you just compile the project as a whole.
